            <section class="bio">
              <p>I found my passion for coding while working as an Industrial Engineering Technician 
              after acquiring my Mechanical Engineering degree. The task that I enjoyed doing the most was basic C# programming in an 
              ERP software and debugging configurators. After talking to many of my developers friends, I learned that my task was similar 
              to those of a developer, but on a more elementary level. From then on I decided to make a career change and enter the Full 
              Stack Web Development program at Thinkful. As a person that takes pleasure in seeing physical progress, web development brings 
              me alot of joy when I look upon the finish product.</p>

              <p>When I'm not hacking away on my keyboard, one of my favorite hobbies is automotive modification
              and maintenance. There's nothing like fine tuning the suspension of a car and going out for a spirited drive. 
              Traveling is definitely up there in my list of favorite things to do as well. Being immersed in a variety of 
              cultures is truly a unique and satisfying experience.</p>
